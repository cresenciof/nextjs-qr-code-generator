1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.

## Installation

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Then, run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Starting the Development Server

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can start the development server with the following command:

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
